        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>I am currently a senior at Chapman University working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science with a minor in Analytics.
            My expected graduation date is December 2023 and I plan on pursuing a career in software engineering or data analytics. I am currently a Data Analytics Intern at 
            Wrecking Yard Baseball where I utilize Python and the pandas library to analyze player data. Other languages I am familiar with include C++, Java, HTML/CSS, and SQL.
            <br>
            <span class="tab"></span>Baseball has always played a key role in my life as I am the treasurer for the Chapman Club Baseball team and have been playing
            since I was five. It was my love for baseball that led me to pursue a career in data analytics and software engineering.
            My first personal project ever was a simple baseball statistics calculator that I created using Java, which led me down a rabbit hole of learning
            about advanced baseball statistics and software design. My current projects revolve around swing data from youth players that train at Wrecking Yard Baseball,
            giving valuable insight to coaches and players on flaws that can't be seen with the naked eye.
